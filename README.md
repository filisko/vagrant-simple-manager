# Vagrant Simple Manager v1.0

This script provides a simple GUI for Vagrant (for lazy people) that you could use to start, stop, restart and SSH into vagrant machines with your default terminal emulator.

## Download
To download and execute the script simple do the following:
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/filisko/vagrant-simple-manager/master/vagrant-sm.sh
chmod +x vagrant-sm.sh
./vagrant-sm.sh
```

## Steps

Once you start the script, the main screen that you will is list of your current vagrant machines.

If you select the vagrant machine and then press 'Manage', you will get a list of the available options (only 1 for now) while the vagrant machine is off (see state 'poweroff' on previous image).

And once you've started the vagrant machine, you will get another list of options (only 3 for now).
